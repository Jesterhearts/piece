      When Kitesail Larcenist enters the battlefield, for each player, choose up to
      one other target artifact or creature that player controls. For as long as Kitesail
      Larcenist remains on the battlefield, the chosen permanents become Treasure
      artifacts with “{T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color” and
      lose all other abilities.
