    When Kitesail Larcenist enters the battlefield, for each player, choose up to
    one other target artifact or creature that player controls. For as long as Kitesail
    Larcenist remains on the battlefield, the chosen permanents become Treasure artifacts
    with “{T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color” and lose all other
